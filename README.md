# Bachelors Thesis

This is a Git-Hub page for the bachelors thesis made in spring 2021, by Jonas Friis. 

It contains relevant implementaions, project idea as well with the thesis itself.

**Abstract**
In this thesis, we present and discuss central and local differential privacy for range counting and the amount of noise added to the output; We do this by implementing different central and local differential private data structures. We implement a flat solution in both central and local DP. We furthermore examine two variations of hierarchical histograms. The data structures are implemented in Python. We then analyze and benchmark the data structures against each other by measuring the error over different range queries.
